Coffee Shop
===========

This repo contains two Python modules and two images. The module 'coffee.py'
is a collection of three classes that model a part of a coffee shop: the shop,
the shelf, and the grinder. It can be imported and used as a command line
interface.

The other module, 'main.py', is an executable GUI based in Tkinter. This is
written over the top of 'coffee.py'. Both modules require Python 2.7 and use
the standard library.
